## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

Annually, waste production surges, with illegal dumpsites proliferating, especially in unaddressed locations. Inadequate recycling exacerbates ecological and health issues, as dumpsites attract disease-carrying pests. This leads to potentially life-threatening diseases, while also impacting the mental well-being of communities residing near these sites.

### How our technology solution can help

Mapping, monitoring and preventing potential illegal dumpsites using Machine Learning

### Our idea


The development process described involves a user-facing application designed to identify potential illegal dump sites. This application leverages a combination of user input, geospatial tools, and machine learning to determine the likelihood of illegal dumping in a given location.

In the first step, users input a location of interest. This initiates the process by providing a geographical reference point for further analysis. The integration of user input in the application ensures that it caters to specific locations and areas of concern.

Geopy and OpenStreetMap (OSM) come into play in the second step. Geopy is a geocoding library that translates user-provided location data into precise geographical coordinates, enabling the application to pinpoint the exact area of interest. OpenStreetMap, a collaborative mapping project, is used to render a detailed map of the selected location. Together, these tools lay the foundation for a comprehensive analysis.

The third step is where the real intelligence of the system shines. The coordinates obtained through Geopy and the map data from OSM are transmitted to IBM's Watson Machine Learning model, known as WatsonX, which is built on the CatBoost algorithm. CatBoost is a machine learning algorithm renowned for its effectiveness in handling geospatial data. WatsonX is specifically trained to assess the provided coordinates and predict whether the location exhibits characteristics indicative of a potential illegal dump site. This is a critical phase in which machine learning analyzes a wide range of geospatial features and trends to make an informed prediction.

The fourth step involves presenting the results to the user. If the location is marked in red on the map, it suggests a high likelihood of illegal dumping in the area. This visual representation offers users a clear and easily understandable indicator of potential concerns. Conversely, if the location appears in green on the map, it signals that the area is likely free from such concerns, providing reassurance to users and authorities alike.


In summary, this user-facing application seamlessly combines user input, geospatial data translation, and the power of machine learning to provide a valuable tool for identifying potential illegal dump sites. By offering a user-friendly and visually intuitive approach to environmental concerns, it empowers individuals and organizations to take proactive steps towards preserving the environment.

1. A user-facing application is created, where users input a location to identify potential illegal dump sites.
2. Geopy and OpenStreetMap are used for translating user's input into geographical coordinates and render map
3. Next, the coordinates obtained through Geopy and the OSM data are transmitted to IBMs Watson Machine Learning model â€” WatsonX built on the CatBoost algorithm. This model is trained to assess the provided coordinates and predict whether the location is a potential illegal dump site based on its geospatial characteristics.
4. If the location is marked in red on the map, it suggests the presence of a potential illegal dumping site. Conversely, if the location appears in green, it indicates that the area is likely free from such concerns.

### Project development roadmap

The project currently focuses on the development of a minimal viable product (MVP) that possesses the capability to identify illegal dumpsites through visual mapping. This will serve as a foundation for the application's functionality and purpose.

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

In the future we plan to iteratively enhance our application 

Product Iteration Phase 2 - Building a robust reporting mechanism. This system will enable users to effectively report instances of illegal dumpsites they encounter, promoting community involvement and action in addressing environmental concerns.

Product Iteration Phase 3 - Enhance the application's overall utility. We will achieve this by incorporating information about legal dumpsites onto our maps. This additional data will provide users with a comprehensive view of disposal options and further support responsible waste management practices.

Product Iteration Phase 4 - EcoEye will take a significant step towards discouraging illegal dumping. We will deploy a comprehensive disincentive system that incorporates advanced surveillance cameras, sensors, and alarming mechanisms. This system will not only help in the identification of illegal dumpers but also serve as a deterrent, promoting responsible waste disposal practices and protecting our environment.
